# BackdropWizard
BackdropWizard is a revolutionary photo enhancement tool. It allows users to capture pictures with their smartphone cameras and then, with the magic of AI, seamlessly replace the background, giving photos a whole new perspective. Additionally, it offers users a library of AI-generated image ideas to spark their creativity.

This repository has a sister repository for the frontend code as well as Clipdrop-Reimagine API.

This repository includes node services for printing the image upon receiving from mobile request. This also includes a node service for generating Diffusion XL images using Segmind and sending it to the mobile device. 
The index.js has code for both the services combined.
